# Rincewind Editor

A safer way to use [Rincewind](https://github.com/equilaterus-gamestudios/rincewind), the magical machine built by druids. Say something wise, the elders are waiting.

## How to start the connection

* Run development and local rituals: 
  ```
  npm start
  ````

* Build distribution for floppy disks:
  ```
  npm run build-web
  npm run build
  ```
